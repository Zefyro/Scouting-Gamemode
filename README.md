# Scouting
This datapack adds `/trigger Scout` command that lets you go to limited spectator gamemode. These limits are "survival friendly" meaning you can't cheat death by using this. When you trigger it again it will teleport you where you started. You can't trigger the "scout mode" if you are in danger: falling, near hostile mobs, in lava or under water.
